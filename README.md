# EYAI: 
## Eye AI

### Overview
EYAI is an innovative AI-driven solution focused on enhancing humanoid robots with realistic eye movement simulation. Leveraging cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques, EYAI aims to replicate human-like eye movements and tracking behaviors, facilitating more natural and engaging interactions between robots and humans. This project is crucial for developers and researchers looking to improve the non-verbal communication capabilities of humanoid robots.

### Features

- **Human Eye Movement Analysis:** Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and understand human eye movement patterns.
- **Real-Time Eye Tracking:** Implements real-time tracking of human eyes, capturing subtle movements and blinks to enhance interaction realism.
- **Simulated Eye Movement:** Enables humanoid robots to mimic realistic human eye movements based on learned data, supporting natural-looking responses and interactions.
- **Learning Module:** Continuously learns from interactions, improving the accuracy and naturalness of eye movement simulations over time.
- **Integration Toolkit:** Provides tools and APIs for easy integration with existing robotic platforms, ensuring compatibility and extensibility.

### Getting Started

1. **Installation**

    Clone the EYAI repository to start integrating realistic eye movement into your humanoid robot project:
    ```
